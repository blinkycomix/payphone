prototype for payphone
A virtual prototype for "Reinvent Payphones". 
This prototype is based on a karaoke machine in mechanics to outstand the rigors of urban traffic. It can be mounted onto a kiosk, or it can be mount into the existing infrastructure of phone booths.  It has mechanical three buttons along the side for "connect", "disconnect", and "emergency services". Along with two payment methods- coin and card. Numeric input is along the bottom with 10 mechanical buttons. When attached online- the screen is large enough to show the user. If desired- a full QWERTY keyboard can be requested for instant text messaging. (This feature is great for directions when you are to meet with friends at a remote location.) It has a handsless speaker slot which is great for capturing speech as the user is looking through a notebook while talking.
The desire to use the user's existing mobile was decided against due to the limitations of sports attire when out on a workout.
